## Others

```
FRAMEBUFFER=y is set in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash (should make the boot screen appear earlier on supported hardware)
DefaultTimeoutStopSec=40s is set in /etc/systemd/system (should make most SystemD Services take less time to stop meaning shutdown speeds are faster)
TapToClick is enabled on libinput globally in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf
```

## Kernel Options

```
amdgpu.runpm=0 radeon.dpm=0 amd_iommu=on iommu=pt amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff

amdgpu.runpm=0 -- prevents the dGPU from being powered down dynamically at runtime,in case of issues with power management / dynamic re-activation of a discrete amdgpu graphics card

radeon.dpm=0 -- deactivate the dynamic power management feature to the open-source AMD Linux graphics driver that is capable of boosting the performance of Radeon GPUs by being able to properly re-clock from their boot frequencies. Dynamic power management also leads to reduced heat output and lower power usage when the graphics processor is idle.

amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff

## Flatpak Overrides

```

> filesystems (list)
List of filesystem subsets to make available to the application. Possible values:

> home
The entire home directory. Available since 0.3.

> home/path
Alias for ~/path Available since 1.10. For better compatibility with older Flatpak versions, prefer to write this as ~/path.

> host
The entire host file system, except for directories that are handled specially by Flatpak. In particular, this shares /home, /media, /opt, /run/media and /srv if they exist.

/dev is not shared: use devices=all; instead.

Parts of /sys are always shared. This option does not make additional files in /sys available.

Additionally, this keyword provides all of the same directories in /run/host as the host-os and host-etc keywords. If this keyword is used in conjunction with one of the host- keywords, whichever access level is higher (more permissive) will be used for the directories in /run/host: for example, host:rw;host-os:ro; is equivalent to host:rw;.

These other reserved directories are currently excluded: /app, /bin, /boot, /etc, /lib, /lib32, /lib64, /proc, /root, /run, /sbin, /tmp, /usr, /var.

Available since 0.3.

> host-os
The host operating system's libraries, executables and static data from /usr and the related directories /bin, /lib, /lib32, /lib64, /sbin. Additionally, this keyword provides access to a subset of /etc that is associated with packaged libraries and executables, even if the host-etc keyword was not used: /etc/ld.so.cache, (used by the dynamic linker) and /etc/alternatives (on operating systems that use it, such as Debian).

To avoid conflicting with the Flatpak runtime, these are mounted in the sandbox at /run/host/usr, /run/host/etc/ld.so.cache and so on.

Available since 1.7.

> host-etc
The host operating system's configuration from /etc.

To avoid conflicting with the Flatpak runtime, this is mounted in the sandbox at /run/host/etc.

Available since 1.7.

> xdg-desktop, xdg-documents, xdg-download, xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share, xdg-videos, xdg-templates
freedesktop.org special directories. Available since 0.3.

> xdg-desktop/path, xdg-documents/path, etc.
Subdirectories of freedesktop.org special directories. Available since 0.4.13.

> xdg-cache, xdg-config, xdg-data
Directories defined by the freedesktop.org Base Directory Specification. Available since 0.6.14.

> xdg-cache/path, xdg-config/path, xdg-data/path
Subdirectories of directories defined by the freedesktop.org Base Directory Specification. Available since 0.6.14.

> xdg-run/path
Subdirectories of the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR defined by the freedesktop.org Base Directory Specification. Note that xdg-run on its own is not supported. Available since 0.4.13.

> /path
An arbitrary absolute path. Available since 0.3.

> ~/path
An arbitrary path relative to the home directory. Available since 0.3.

> ~
The same as home. Available since 1.10. For better compatibility with older Flatpak versions, prefer to write this as home.

> One of the above followed by :ro
Make the given directory available read-only.

> One of the above followed by :rw
Make the given directory available read/write. This is the default.

> One of the above followed by :create
Make the given directory available read/write, and create it if it does not already exist.
